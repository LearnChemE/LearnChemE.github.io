              This simulation seeks to illustrate how Bernoulliâ€™s principle should be applied while also accounting for pipe losses. There are three tanks in this simulation, which are connected via pipes and a common hinge. The goal of this simulation is to allow the height of tank B to be a variable and determine the direction in which the water should flow. The user is encouraged to change the height of tank B using slider and observe the changes in the direction of water flow.  The arrows indicate the answer.

            <p>A user is encouraged to perform calculations assuming friction factor f = 0.02 for all pipes.</p>
