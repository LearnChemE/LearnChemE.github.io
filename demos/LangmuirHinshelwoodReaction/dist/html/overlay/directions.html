            Oxygen oxidizes CO to CO₂ on a supported metal catalyst in an isothermal plug flow reactor. Use buttons to select which plot to display: partial pressures, catalyst coverages, or reaction rate as a function of distance down the reactor. Use sliders to vary the temperature and the ratio of the CO feed partial pressure to the O₂ feed partial pressure. Because the rate-determining step is the reaction of adsorbed CO and adsorbed O, and because CO adsorbs more strongly than O, increasing the CO feed partial pressure can decrease the rate of CO₂ formation because the CO surface coverage becomes much higher than the O surface coverage.
