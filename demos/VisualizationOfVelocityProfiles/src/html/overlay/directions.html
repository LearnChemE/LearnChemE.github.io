          <p><strong>Learning objective:</strong><br>(1) Understand force balances during a skydive.<br>(2) Understand how safety is engineered in real-life scenarios.</p>
          <p><strong>How to use the simulation:</strong><br>Choose a height of the skydive and change the parachute diameter to understand when to open a parachute for a safe landing.</p>
          <p><strong>Qualitative understanding:</strong><br>Why do you think jumping from 10,000 ft (3,300 m) is safer than jumping from 1,800 ft (600 m)?<br>At a safe velocity of 3.7 m/s, the minimum required parachute radius comes out to be approximately 4 m. Any radius smaller than this results in a parachute that is too small, regardless of the skydiver’s height. Why do you think that is the case?<br>In the output window, the terminal velocity noted is sometimes lower than the safe velocity. Still, the final velocity is not the terminal velocity—why do you think that is the case?</p>
          <p><strong>Quantitative understanding:</strong><br>Choose a height of 3,300 m.<br>(i) Calculate the velocity of an object if it reaches the ground without any deceleration.<br>(ii) Calculate the terminal velocity of a 71 kg skydiver without a parachute assuming that the drag coefficient for a human is 1 and the skydiving arch position area is 0.6 m<sup>2</sup>. If the safe landing speed is 3.7 m/s, how much does this number come out to be? The density of air is 1 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<br>(iii) Calculate the terminal velocity of a skydiver with a parachute assuming that the drag coefficient for the parachute is 1.75 and the parachute has a radius of 4 m. To simplify your calculations for this part, you can ignore the drag contribution of the human.</p>
