As outlined in the Directions tab, the learning objective of this simulation is to understand the competition between the surface tension and gravity in setting droplet shape, and the impact of contact angle.

<p>
The simulation is set by balancing the hydrostatic pressure with the surface tension pressure. The mathematical details are complicated and are omitted for brevity. However, they were directly adapted from the paper by Fatollahi and Hajirahimi, which can be accessed here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1304.6366" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1304.6366</a>.
