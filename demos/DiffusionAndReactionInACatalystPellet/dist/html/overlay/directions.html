          The overall rate of reaction in an isothermal, porous, spherical catalyst pellet is calculated for a
          first-order, gas-phase reaction that is limited by diffusion in the catalyst pores. This simulation
          plots the reactant concentration inside the catalyst pellet versus the pellet radius. Use sliders to
          set the pellet radius, diffusivity, and reaction rate constant. The Thiele modulus is a dimensionless
          number that represents the ratio of reaction rate to diffusion rate. The effectiveness factor is the
          overall rate of reaction divided by the rate of reaction if the entire catalyst were at the external
          surface concentration of 0.040 mmol/cm<sup>3</sup>. The diffusivity slider represents diffusivity
          D<sub>AB</sub>, not effective diffusivity D<sub>e</sub>. The values used in calculations are: pellet
          porosity = 0.40, constriction factor = 0.80, and tortuosity = 3.0.
