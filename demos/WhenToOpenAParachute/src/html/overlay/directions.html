          <p><strong>Learning objective:</strong><br>(1) Understand force balance during a skydive and how drag changes after deployment.<br>(2) Explore how parachute size and jump altitude affect landing safety.</p>
          <p><strong>How to use this demo:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set the jump altitude and parachute diameter using the sliders.</li>
            <li>The parachute automatically opens at t = 30 s (shown by the dotted line).</li>
            <li>Aim to land at <= 3.5 m/s. The green band on the speed plot highlights a typical safe range (2.5-3.5 m/s).</li>
            <li>Outcome messages (exactly one will show):
              <br> - safely landed
              <br> - hit the ground at unsafe speed since parachute never opened
              <br> - hit the ground at unsafe speed since parachute too small
            </li>
            <li>If the ground is not reached within 360 s, the demo still classifies the outcome using the post-deployment terminal speed: within the safe range => "safely landed", otherwise => "too small".</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Questions to consider:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why does opening higher generally make a safe landing more achievable?</li>
            <li>For the same altitude, how does increasing diameter shift the speed curve after t = 30 s?</li>
            <li>Why is the final speed at touchdown not always equal to the post-deployment terminal speed?</li>
          </ul>
