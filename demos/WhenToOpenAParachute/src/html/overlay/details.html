          <p>Assume \(m\) is the mass of the person, \(g\) is gravity and \(v\) is velocity, \(c_{Dh}\) is the human drag coefficient, \(A_h\) is the human projecteda rea, \(c_{Dp}\) is the parachute draf coefficient, \(A_p\) is the parachute projected area, we can write the equation of motion as:</p>
          <p class="text-center">\[ m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \rho \frac{v^2}{2} C_{Dh} A_{h} - \rho \frac{v^2}{2} C_{Dp} A_{p} H(t-t_{open}), \]</p>
          <p>where \(H\) is heaviside function. The above is easily integrated with \(v(0)=0\), along with</p>
          <p class="text-center">\[ -\frac{dh}{dt} = v, \]</p>
          <p>with \(h(0)=h_0\). To find the latest time to open the parachute, we find the roots for \(t_{open}\) such that \(v(h=1)\) is 3.7 m/s. Finally, look at the time and velocity versus time show that as soon as the parachute is released, the person almost reaches the ground. This is done so as to find the latest one can open the parachute. In real life scenarios, it is typical to have 5 minutes of parachute time. How will you adjust the condition to re-evaluate \(t_{open}\)?</p>
