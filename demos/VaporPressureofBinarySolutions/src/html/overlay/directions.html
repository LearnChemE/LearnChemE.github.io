            This simulation shows how the partial pressures of the two components (A-blue, B-green) of a
            binary mixture change with mole fraction of component B. An ideal solution obeys Raoult's
            law; the partial pressure of each component is proportional to its mole fraction:
            <em>P<sub>A</sub> = x<sub>A</sub> P<sub>A</sub><sup>sat</sup></em> and
            <em>P<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>B</sub> P<sub>B</sub><sup>sat</sup></em>, where
            P<sup>sat</sup><sub>A</sub> and P<sup>sat</sup><sub>B</sub> are the saturation pressures of A
            and B at a given temperature. For an ideal solution, the total pressure
            <em>P = x<sub>A</sub>P<sub>A</sub><sup>sat</sup> + x<sub>B</sub>P<sub>B</sub><sup>sat</sup></em>
            is shown by the black curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most real solutions exhibit deviations from Raoult's law. For a positive deviation,
            <em>P<sub>A</sub> &gt; x<sub>A</sub>P<sub>A</sub><sup>sat</sup></em> and
            <em>P<sub>B</sub> &gt; x<sub>B</sub>P<sub>B</sub><sup>sat</sup></em>; this indicates that
            attractive interactions between like molecules is greater than between A and B molecules.
            For a negative deviation, <em>P<sub>A</sub> &lt; x<sub>A</sub>P<sub>A</sub><sup>sat</sup></em>
            and <em>P<sub>B</sub> &lt; x<sub>B</sub>P<sub>B</sub><sup>sat</sup></em>; this indicates that
            attractive interactions between like molecules is less than between A and B molecules.
          </p>

            When the slider for deviation from ideality is at a value other than zero, the non‑ideal
            behavior is shown by the solid lines and the dashed lines indicate ideal behavior. Even for
            non‑ideal solutions, Raoult's law is asymptotically approached for A as x<sub>A</sub>
            approaches 1 and for B as x<sub>B</sub> approaches 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dilute solutions, on the other hand, are approximated by Henry's law:
            <em>P<sub>A</sub> = x<sub>A</sub>K<sub>A</sub></em> for x<sub>A</sub> close to zero and
            <em>P<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>B</sub>K<sub>B</sub></em> for x<sub>B</sub> close to zero. Check
            “Show Henry's law” to display this behavior represented by dashed purple and orange lines.
