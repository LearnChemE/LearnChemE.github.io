Either one or three solutions are possible, and when three solutions are obtained, the middle solution (at the intersection of the two plots) is unstable.",

The RTD is a function displaying the likelihood that a single particle will spend a certain amount of time in the reactor. For example, if the plot of the RTD is bell-curved, this means that it is more likely that a particle will spend the amount of time corresponding to the center of the bell curve in the CSTR than it will towards the tails of the bell curve. The plot of the RTD of a single CSTR is an exponential decay, whereas the plot of the RTD of multiple CSTRs in series is bell-curved. Note that the plot shown in this simulation is for the RTD of the entire system, that is, how likely a particle will spend a certain amount of time traveling through every CSTR, from first to last.",

The reaction is typically carried out at around 200 bar and 675–725 K. Sliders vary the pressure and temperature. Gases are assumed to behave ideally, although at the high pressures used for this reaction, the gases are nonideal. Four moles of reactants form two moles of product, so raising the pressure shifts equilibrium toward products. Initially, the system is filled with one mole of NH<sub>3</sub> and allowed to reach equilibrium. Additional N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and/or NH<sub>3</sub> at can be added at constant pressure, and the effect on the equilibrium is observed. Le Chatelier&#8217;s principle predicts that when N<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub> are added, the reaction goes to the right, whereas when NH<sub>3</sub> is added, the reaction shifts to the left. However, when the N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is sufficiently high, adding N<sub>2</sub> shifts reaction to the left (i.e. adding N<sub>2</sub> decreases the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> and increases the amount of H<sub>2</sub>), contrary to what Le Chatelier&#8217;s principle predicts. This happens because adding N<sub>2</sub> decreases the mole fraction of H<sub>2</sub>, and because the H<sub>2</sub> mole fraction is cubed in the equilibrium expression, Nh<sub>3</sub> reacts to increase the number of moles of H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The temperature-composition phase diagram for two immiscible liquids, benzene and water, is at constant pressure. When the pressure is changed with a slider, the saturation temperatures change. The overall benzene mole fraction can also be changed with a slider. The bar graph shows the moles of liquid water (blue), liquid benzene (orange), and vapor (red), which contains both components. The system contains one mole total. You can add heat to change the temperature and amounts in each phase. At a given pressure, all three phases co-exist at only one temperature. When heat is added at this temperature, one of the liquid phases completely evaporates before the temperature increases.</p>",

The number of moles of each phase, which are shown in the bar graph (along with the mole fractions of component B in the phases), are determined from mole balances.
