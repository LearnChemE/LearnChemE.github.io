           In this digital experiment, N2 is bubbled through a container with a mixture of n-pentane and n-hexane. Vapor-liquid equilibrium is obtained in the bubbles before they leave the liquid phase. As n-pentane and n-hexane are removed in the exiting gas, the liquid level in the bubbler drops. The level of the liquid is measured as a function of time at three temperatures, and material balances and Raoult's law are used to calculate how the liquid level is expected to decrease with time.
