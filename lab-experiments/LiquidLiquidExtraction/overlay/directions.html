              This digital experiment applies mass balances to a liquid-liquid extraction unit. Water is used as a solvent to extract acetic acid from a feed solution of acetic acid/chloroform/water so that the extract is enriched in acetic acid and the raffinate tank is depleted of acetic acid. Turn on the solvent pump by clicking the "ON" side of the switch, then click on the solvent valve to open it. After a delay, the feed pump will turn on and the feed valve will open. Click "Reset" to start over. Click "Worksheet" to download the worksheet that describes how to carry out this experiment.
