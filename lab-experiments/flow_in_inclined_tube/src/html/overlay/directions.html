           The experiment consists of two cylindrical pipes, each with a length of 30 cm, where water is being pumped
through a syringe pump. The flowrate can be set to low, medium, and high. The beaker next to the pipe helps calculate the
flowrate by using a stopwatch and measuring the volume as a function of time. There is a gauge pressure sensor that
displays the value at the inlet of the first pipe. The goal of this experiment is to calculate the inside diameter of the pipe and the
density and viscosity of the fluid that is flowing through the pipes. Zoom with the scroll wheel and drag the mouse to move the image.
