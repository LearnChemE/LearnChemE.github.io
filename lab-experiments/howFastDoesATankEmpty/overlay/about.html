            This digital experiment was created in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, at University of Colorado Boulder for 
            <a href="https://www.LearnChemE.com" target="_blank">LearnChemE.com</a> by Sanath Kavatooru under the direction of Ankur Gupta. 
            It is a JavaScript/HTML5 implementation of a Mathematica simulation that was prepared by Mark D. Normand, Maria G. Corradini, and Micha Peleg 
            and modified by Neil Hendren and John L. Falconer. It was prepared with financial support from the National Science Foundation 
            (DUE 2336987 and 2336988) in collaboration with Washington State University. Address any questions or comments to 
            <a href="mailto:LearnChemE@gmail.com">LearnChemE@gmail.com</a>. If this simulation is too big or too small for your screen, 
            zoom out or in using command - or command + on Mac or ctrl - or ctrl + on Windows.
