							This experiment concentrates a dilute sugar solution feed by boiling off water in a single-effect evaporator using saturated steam as the heat source. 
							The feed temperatures and flow rate of the sugar solution are set with controllers. 
							The steam feed pressure is set with a controller and this sets the steam temperature and flow rate. 
							The rates of concentrate and condensate leaving the evaporator are measured by weighing the flows out. 
							Mass and energy balances are carried out. It aims to demonstrate the effects of operating parameters on evaporator efficiency. 
							Use the scroll wheel or pinch the screen to zoom, and drag your mouse or touchscreen to pan the camera.

						This digital experiment was created in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/chbe">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</a> at University of Colorado Boulder 
            for <a href="http://learncheme.com">LearnChemE.com</a> by Drew Smith under the direction of Professor John L. Falconer. It is based on a
