# [LearnChemE.github.io](https://learncheme.github.io)

This repository includes simulations created for https://www.learncheme.com/ to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of chemical and biological engineering, among other related topics. It also contains embedabble features and scripts used on LearnChemE. Contact us at learncheme@gmail.com to collaborate or inquire.

`/demos/` **contains the source code for all of the simulations available on our website.**

`/lab-experiments/` **contains our virtual laboratory experiments.** See https://learncheme.com/virtual-laboratories/ for more information.

`/accordion_iframes/` contains embeddable "accordion" elements used on LearnChemE.com.

`/home_page/` contains styling and scripts for the [LearnChemE.github.io](https://learncheme.github.io) home page.

`/iframe/` contains embeddable quizzes covering various engineering topics.

`/learnchemejs/` contains the first prototypes of our in-browser simulations, developed in 2017, which served as a precursor for all of the simulations developed thereafter.

`/libraries/` contains JavaScript libraries that were modified from their original sources.

`/media/` contains common assets used by multiple different applications within this repository.

`/quiz_questions/` is a quiz used within a learning module posted on LearnChemE.
